Proof of concept since viedo hosting services let you store unlimited videos, you can store infinite data if used correctly 
Project use lodepng,ffmpeg and opencv2 to encode file to viedo format 

result : file size is 20x bigger after reconstuction and 12.6 %  of curruption with video length increasing 1600% after lossy compression from hosting service
